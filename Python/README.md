Python
======
Welcome to my python folder, the most noteworthy script in here is my stream.py file in the Stream to VLC folder, which allows you to play youtube/twitch streams in vlc media player working with a external program called livestreamer. This script allows you to check the status of specific users on twitch, or a list of users using the list.json and it also keeps track on how many times you watched a specific user and the total time you've watched them for.

Like all of my other code its open source, if you modify it just give me credit please
