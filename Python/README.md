Python
======
Welcome to my python folder, the most noteworthy script in here is my stream.py file in the Stream to VLC folder, which allows you to play youtube/twitch streams in vlc media player working with a external program called livestreamer. This script allows you to chect the status of specific users on twitch, or a list of users useing the list.json and it also keeps track on how many times you watched a specific user and the total time you've watched them for.
