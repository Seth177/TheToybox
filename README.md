Welcome, This is the git where I put all of my code that I have been messing around with. I've been using it to learn whatever language it happens to be by taking it apart and messing around with what it does. Feel free to make pulls of it and mess around with it, I don't care.

This will include whatever I make in whatever language it is, I will always keep this up to date. At this current moment the only code in here is JavaScript where I've made a few silly stuff while I'm learning JS, as well as HTML and PHP that is on my website and runs the code for me to test.

Ive been focusing more on python for now cause i find it intresting and useful to make little useful utility's such as my StreamToVLC or AtomPortable

If you want to see some of my javascript and other browser compatible code i would have said "Goto my Website here [Insert Website URL]" but the raspberry pi running it derped out so its no longer up
